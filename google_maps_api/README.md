# Google Maps API Tutorials

This directory contains tutorials and examples for using the Google Maps API.

In order to use these assets, you will need to obtain an API key from Google and add it to `loadApiKey.js`

```js
apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace with your actual API key
```

**Please Note:** This file is ignored by Git, so your API key will not be committed to version control.

An API key can be obtained from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) using the following guide: [Set up the Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
